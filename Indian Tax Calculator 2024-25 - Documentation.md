### Modifying the Tax Calculator

#### Updating Tax Rates
To update the tax rates for future financial years:

1. Locate the tax calculation functions in `script.js`:
   - `calculateOldRegimeTax(income)` for the old tax regime
   - `calculateNewRegimeTax(income)` for the new tax regime

2. Modify the tax slabs and rates according to the latest Finance Act:

```javascript
// Example: Updating New Regime tax rates
function calculateNewRegimeTax(income) {
    let tax = 0;
    
    if (income <= 300000) {
        tax = 0;
    } else if (income <= 600000) {
        tax = (income - 300000) * 0.05;
    } else if (income <= 900000) {
        tax = 15000 + (income - 600000) * 0.1;
    } else if (income <= 1200000) {
        tax = 45000 + (income - 900000) * 0.15;
    } else if (income <= 1500000) {
        tax = 90000 + (income - 1200000) * 0.2;
    } else {
        tax = 150000 + (income - 1500000) * 0.3;
    }
    
    return tax;
}
```

#### Adding New Income Sources
To add new income sources:

1. Add new input fields in the HTML:
```html
<div class="subsection">
    <h4>New Income Source</h4>
    <div class="input-group">
        <label for="new-income">Enter Amount</label>
        <input type="number" id="new-income" placeholder="₹">
    </div>
</div>
```

2. Update the tax calculation function in `script.js` to include the new income:
```javascript
// Get the new income value
const newIncome = parseFloat(document.getElementById('new-income').value) || 0;

// Add it to total income
totalIncome += newIncome;
```

#### Enhancing PDF Generation
To modify the PDF report format:

1. Locate the `generatePDF()` function in `script.js`
2. Modify the content and styling as needed:
```javascript
// Add new content to PDF
doc.setFontSize(14);
doc.setTextColor(30, 144, 255);
doc.text('New Section Title', 14, newY);

// Add new table to PDF
doc.autoTable({
    startY: newY + 10,
    head: [['Column 1', 'Column 2']],
    body: [
        ['Data 1', 'Data 2'],
        ['Data 3', 'Data 4']
    ],
    theme: 'grid'
});
```
